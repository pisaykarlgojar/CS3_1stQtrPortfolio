# 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
### conditional statements - Very fun and I got the hang of it. Mostly because of all the ifs and elses.
### Basic coding in javascript (like input & output) - Honestly, I am pretty good at the simple stuff. When there needs to be more complicated stuff like loops, I sturggle there.
### Implementing the internal Javascript file - The coding to do this was fairly simple to remember. It is quite literally just referencing the script (If i am not mistaken.)
### Loops -They were fun cuz the format was easy to follow. Although yesterday, when the aexam happened all of that was wiped from my head. hehe

# 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
### How to commit to github - Genuinely the first time the instructions to commit changes were given, were so unclear and confusing. I kinda saw that there were some processes that were left out but they were vital to continue. 
### True/False statements - I answered these type of questions on a Kahoot quiz, which they were somewhat confusing to me.
### Syntax - Because of some obsession with python and/or C++, i mixed up some of the syntax and just put some stuff like "print" or "cout" until I realized I'm in HTML/Javascript.
### Evaluating blocks of code before they are executed - Those questions mess me up sometimes by putting brackets that I didn't pick up on, or putting a function outside the domain without it being called.
### Calling functions - To be honest, I still don't know much of this as it would be evident in my long test results. Mostly because I hadn't really taught myself coding to call functions.

# 3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
### Knowing myself, I would definitely need to sleep a necessary amount of hours (as my body feels so) to get the needed amount of rest. Einstein is my personal inspiration for that. Then I would set up my laptop in a calm environment (praticularly a quiet one) and start working with calm music. (or at least whatever i consider to be worth listening to while studying.) Then Ill sleep again. Socialize, then look back, then apply. w3schools should be a MASSIVE help in this process.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

## Helpful activities
1. Kahoot quiz - I loved participating like that even if i lost some of the questions, I enjoyed it.
2. Speed test - was fun and exciting, and it pushed me to at least try.

## Not as effective activities
1. N/A - I actually cannot recall what activities were not helpful.
2. N/A - Same for this.
